                    1. Almost all of you will become advocates after receiving this and spread the word about us better than we can.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Many people will want more help from us and join the "WebDev Employeed Roadmap"
                    <br><br>
                    3. We make $43,890 by first giving $43,890 of value to the market
                    <br><br>
                    4. Helping devs at their start is fulfilling and we get better everytime I do it
                    <br><br>
                    5. This is way more fun than posting a 2 long boring hours of technical content.

                    2. So you can get inspired and break out of a rut
                    <br><br>
                    3. Personal advice from Tudor is better than going to the spa.

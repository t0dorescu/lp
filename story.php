                  <b>Coding is way too CONFUSING. Wish you had a little HELP?</b>
                  <br><br>
                  Hello friend… yes you, the one who reads this and asks him why is he reading this, I have an important message that will blow your mind. But first, let me ask you something…
                  <br><br>
                  What if someone gave you a dollar every time you quit or thought of leaving programming for something better or maybe something easier?
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Be HONEST. You’re kind of embarrassed by your own code. Aren’t you?</b>
                  <br><br>
                  I know I was.
                  <br><br>
                  <b style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--primary-color);">
                  Here’s What It’s All About
                  </b>
                  <br><br>
                  I remember the year was 2011. It was, I think, the end of November, close to my birthday. While I was sitting in my parent's house, melting my eyes into that bright 15” screen in my dark room, I suddenly had a sobering realization. My life will be one giant endless howling winter when I arrive in my 30s. It’s going to be cold, lonely, and without any color. Then I’ll die.
                  <br><br>
                  Worse than that, I’ll have to get a job… Ohhh boy, if I’m complaining about developer jobs now, I don’t even want to imagine the agony of working 10-hour shifts at our local convenience store.
                  <br><br>
                  I had to do something. I had to move quickly. It was already 3-4 years since I started then quit a bunch of programming languages… JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C++, Visual Basic even… but everything was still illogical. 
                  <br><br>
                  I felt discouraged. The more I tried, the worse it was. <b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold;">It felt like quicksand</b>. 
                  <br><br>
                  The only project I got paid for was a client in 2008 who was a family friend btw.
                  <br><br>
                  There is a bright side, though.
                  <br><br>
                  Back then, the internet wasn’t full of crap like today. I'm not sure how I’ve come up with this, but <b>out of desperation, I’ve had to invent a plan that I can execute</b>. 
                  <br><br>
                  The goal was this: 
                  <br><br>
                  by the following year's end of summer, I’ll be a fully-employed software developer. That was the dream.
                  <br><br>
                  <b style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--primary-color);">“It was crucial to come up with a way to get industry experience 
                  without having industry experience.”</b>
                  <br><br>
                  Let’s get real here for a second. Nobody in the history of mankind has hired someone for a developer role, just because he made flappy birds from a youtube video. Be honest, guys.
                  <br><br>
                  Talking about birds, it was a chicken and an egg situation. You need an egg to have a chicken, and you need a chicken to have an egg. You have none of them. What do you do?
                  <br><br>
                  I decided to get some eggs.
                  <br><br>
                  After I had eaten them, I decided to make my own website/app kinda-off. Instead of going in a million directions, I’ve done this project with a professional approach.
                  <br><br>
                  I gave myself a tech project consultation. 
                  <br><br>
                  I imagine I’m the client. Being in the position of the money man, what questions would I ask a developer? What would I expect, want from him?
                  <br><br>
                  Then I imagined being on the other receiving end. I imagine I’m the developer, and what type of questions would I ask my client to understand his needs better.
                  <br><br>
                  This weird approach made this whole thing more real. I then learned that imagination is everything. It’s part of being a developer. It’s what you get paid for. Remember this quote:
                    <br><br>
                  <i><b>“I see it when I believe it.”</b></i>
                  <br><br>
                  Let’s get back to our story. So, once I had down the questions and answers in a document, I designed wireframes, made them through photoshop, split the project into categories, and created tasks for each category.
                  <br><br>
                  This got me so so excited because I was finally doing a real-life project for which companies pay top money.
                  <br><br>
                  <b style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--primary-color);">Productivity and performance 
                  went through the roof!</b>
                  <br><br>
                  I’ve finally cracked it.
                  <br><br>
                  That one spark of genius got me my first commercial project on my cv.
                  <br><br>
                  Parents had a telecommunication company. Even better, I did the same process and did their commercial project.
                  <br><br>
                  I now had two projects.
                  <br><br>
                  It’s easy to find someone nearby that needs programming work for their company.
                  <br><br>
                  Just remember, professionally speaking, I was keeping myself to a higher standard ( I was still partying, it’s my 20s, after all ).
                  <br><br>
                  However, I behaved like a professional when I stepped into meetings. I’ve redecorated my room to be more like an office. Believe it or not, I got clients to come by my house for consultations.
                  <br><br>
                  I contacted companies through email, phone calls, and even going there in person with a clipboard. 
                  <br><br>
                  <b>I was on a mission.</b>
                  <br><br>
                  Each new client I signed up with started bringing me more confidence, skill, plus projects on my resume.
                  <br><br>
                  For each job I’ve done, I used my consulting method. Like a serious business, like a serious programmer/consultant.
                  <br><br>
                  Sometimes, I’ll just offer them a free demo project and put that on my portfolio.
                  <br><br>
                  The point is, I was doing the legwork, and <b>it didn’t take me more than five months to skip wasting years of being an internship or junior in some shitty corporate company only to beg for a mid-level position.</b>
                  <br><br>
                  Finally, around July 2012, I had 2-3 pages on my resume, so I emailed serious software companies in the bigger cities. I got invited to maybe 4-5 interviews and got hired for a mid-level position.
                  <br><br>
                  Couldn’t believe it. My very first job was as a mid-level developer. Just like that.
                  <br><br>
                  I was handed the responsibility of developing complex projects. You'll grow fast when you get to work on a production project with actual paying users.
                  <br><br>
                  I’ve always used my analytical consulting way of asking the right questions and <b>applied true problem-solving.</b>
                  <br><br>
                  <b style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--primary-color);">True problem-solving is 
                  concernedly misunderstood</b>
                  <br><br>
                  It’s never about the actual code or algorithms. It’s always about understanding requirements. That’s where everybody gets it wrong.
                  <br><br>
                  And man, social media makes it worse.
                  <br><br>
                  I see it everywhere, the blind leading the blind.
                  <br><br>
                  Developers with a few years experience suddenly start teaching through cheap courses.
                  <br><br>
                  Wanna-be developers think it’s about the code. It isn’t.
                  It’s about the people.
                  <br><br>
                  The more I invested in my people approach, the more I earned.
                  <br><br>
                  Now I’m close to $100.000 per year and working entirely remotely in Romania. Money is nice, but I find it criminal not to share my knowledge. To get developers out of the coding jungle they got lost in years ago.
                  <br><br>
                  This year I’ve decided to mentor 30 eager-to-learn individuals directly. They helped figure out exactly how to tailor this approach to make it work for them.
                  <br><br>
                  Seeing the students getting the results they’ve always wanted but were out of reach really filled my heart with joy.
                  <br><br>
                  Radu worked for me on a few commercial startups, and because of that, he got the proper experience (+guidance) to land his first mid-level front-end developer job.
